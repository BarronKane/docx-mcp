MCP configuration | Junie Documentation MCP configurationYou can connect Junie CLI to external tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP). Junie CLI uses the same MCP JSON configuration as Junie in JetBrains IDEs.The /mcp slash command shows the list of configured MCP servers and the MCP Installation Assistant to guide you through adding, editing, or troubleshooting configs for MCP servers.MCP Installation AssistantJunie's MCP Installation Assistant (Ctrl+A) is an AI helper that streamlines and simplifies the process of adding new MCP servers. It guides you through adding MCP servers from a registry of pre-configured servers or from scratch.When adding a server from the registry, Junie CLI automatically configures the correct command or URL and prompts the user for any required secrets or environment variables.When adding a server from scratch, it searches the official MCP registry for the proper server configuration, prompts for parameters, env variables, secrets, or API tokens if needed, adds the server configuration to the mcp.json file, and verifies the server startup.Add an MCP serverUse the /mcp command to open the MCP server configuration screen.Press Ctrl+A to open and search the list of pre-configured MCP servers.If the MCP server you need is not on the list, press Ctrl+A once again to set up the server configuration from scratch.Select the server installation scope:Project — MCP server configs are stored in the .junie/mcp/mcp.json file at the root of your project. This file can be checked into version control and shared across all team members.For project-scope installations, avoid sharing secrets or sensitive environment variables if the .junie/mcp/mcp.json file is committed to version control.User — user-scope MCP configs are stored in ~/.junie/mcp/mcp.json and available across all projects on your machine while remaining private to your user account.Select the server connection type:Remote — Connect to a hosted server via HTTP/HTTPS.Junie CLI connects to an MCP server hosted on a remote machine or service.Local — Run on your machine (Docker, npx, or binary).Junie CLI starts an MCP server instance locally, e.g. using the npx command or via Docker.OAuth authorizationRemote MCP servers that require OAuth authorization are added to the list of configured servers with an Authorization required status. Use MCP Installation Assistant to set up OAuth authorization:Select the server on the list to open its configuration menu.Select → Authorize and then follow the steps to login in the respective server's browser page that opens.Verify that the server's status has changed to Active.Add an MCP server from JSON configurationIf you have a JSON configuration for an MCP server, you can add it manually directly to the .junie/mcp/mcp.json file at the project or user scope.The mcp.json file uses the following JSON structure: { "mcpServers": { "ServerName": { "type": "command", "command": "npx", "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything"], "env": { "ENV_VAR": "value" }, "enabled": true }, "RemoteServer": { "type": "url", "url": "https://mcp.example.com/v1", "enabled": true } } } Manually added configurations are imported to the list of MCP servers and enabled by default. To verify that the server is available to Junie CLI and active, use the /mcp command.List configured MCP serversTo list all configured MCP servers, as well as disable/enable, modify, or delete existing configurations, use the /mcp command. The list shows:MCP server name.Installation scope (project or user).Server status (Starting/Active/Inactive/Disabled/Failed/Authorization required).Servers that are neither Active nor Disabled can be either Inactive or Failed.The Inactive status indicates that the server is correctly configured and enabled but is not currently running.The Failed status indicates that an error occurred while attempting to connect to the server, the server cannot be started or crashes while running. This could be due to invalid configuration, authentication failure, missing dependencies, or server's runtime crash.Configuration for MCP servers is stored in the mcp.json file either at the project root in the .junie/mcp/ folder (project scope) or on your machine in ~/.junie/mcp/ (user scope).Enable or disable an MCP serverThe MCP servers connected via MCP Installation Assistant or imported from the mcp.json file are enabled by default.To disable a server, list all the configured servers with the /mcp command, select the necessary server, and then select the → Disable action. To enable a previously disabled server, use → Enable.06 February 2026Using Junie in the terminalSlash command reference
